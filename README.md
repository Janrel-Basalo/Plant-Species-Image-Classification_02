# Plant-Species-Image-Classification_02

### A. This project train image to classify what type of plant it upload on the teachble machine and show the percentage of what type of plant it is 
### B. i choose marsilea minuta also known as small water clover is an aquatic plant that has four leaf. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DTieTpSlDW2YYhvnSSbKKMoR5gzf7qMF?usp=drive_link

## 1. How did the number of images per class affect your model’s accuracy? 
### Ans. the more image i upload the more higher the accuracy i get but that defend on how good your image quality upload to.
## 2. Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why?
### Ans. Dwarf Chain Sword because he has alot of same species.
## 3. How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results?
### Ans. it increase the accuracy of the training at higer percentage.
## 4. What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling?
### Ans. The dataset i choose was hard to get because its aquatic and some of it are hard to find on internet.
## 5. If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why?
### Ans. the quality of the image because thats were my model based his accuracy about.
